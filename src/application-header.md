The Pattern is required as a global element when the application uses "NYC.ID."

*The look and feel of NYC.ID coordinates with NYC.gov, and includes two elements: 1) An application header—required; displays the NYC.gov logo and your application name, and includes a few other items. 2) An application brand banner—optional, but recommended; displays your application logo.*

*The application header is black banner that must appear at the very top—above all content and navigation elements—of all pages within your application. The application header has two configurations. 1) Anonymous: The user is not logged in. NYC.ID Authenticated: The user is logged in with a NYC.ID account.*

The "Log In," "Log Out," and "Profile" links are not required in the Pattern if they are present in the [Navigation](navigation) and [Menu](menu) Patterns.
